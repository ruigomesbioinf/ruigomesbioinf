### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Python developing and Bioinformatics algorithms
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Django and PyGame on my free times.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m actually a Biology student cleverly disguised as a Python developer. It has been now 1 year of this adventure as a double agent and I couldn't be happier.
